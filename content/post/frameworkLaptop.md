## What is Framework?

When it comes to buying a new laptop, there are a lot of factors to consider. The hardware, the build quality, the price, and the overall user experience are all important factors. But what about upgradability and repairability? This is where Framework comes in. Framework is a laptop company that is revolutionizing the industry by offering laptops that are modular, upgradable, and repairable. In this blog post, we will discuss Framework's open source contribution, their new products, and their upgradability with examples.

## Open Source Contribution

Framework is committed to open source technology and has made significant contributions to the industry. They have open-sourced their hardware design and firmware, making it easier for other companies to adopt their technology. This means that other companies can use Framework's technology in their own products, which promotes sustainability and reduces e-waste.

## New Products

Framework recently released their 13-inch and 16-inch laptops, which are designed to be modular and upgradable. The laptops come with a modular mainboard that can be easily replaced or upgraded. The laptops also have a replaceable battery, which is a rarity in the laptop industry. Additionally, the laptops have a wide range of ports, including USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, and even an SD card reader.

The 16 inch version in particular is quite interesting, as it has a custom PCIe x8 interface at the back which can be used for multiple swappable expansions like

- Dedicated GPUs
- Swappable Batteries
- AI Accelerators 
- SSD Modules

The Framework Laptop 16 inch also has a completely modular keyboard deck, enabling even more functionality.



## Upgradability 

The upgradability of Framework laptops is what sets them apart from other laptops on the market. Users can easily upgrade the RAM, storage, and Wi-Fi card without needing any special skills or tools. Additionally, Framework offers a range of expansion cards that can be easily inserted into the laptop to add extra ports, such as an additional USB-C port or an Ethernet port.

For example, if you have a 13-inch Framework laptop and you want to upgrade the RAM, all you need to do is remove the back cover and insert a new RAM module. The process is simple and can be done in a matter of minutes. This is a stark contrast to other laptops on the market, where upgrading the RAM often requires disassembling the entire laptop.

# DIY

The Framework Laptop website offers a unique and user-friendly DIY system that allows users to customize and build their own laptops based on their specific needs and preferences. The website features an interactive "Build Your Own" tool that guides users through the process of selecting the components they want to include in their laptop, such as the processor, memory, storage, display, and even the OS!

The website also provides detailed information on each component, including specifications and pricing, so users can make informed decisions. Once users have selected their components, they can order them and receive them in a DIY kit that includes all the necessary tools and instructions for assembling the laptop.

One of the key benefits of this DIY system is that it allows users to easily upgrade or replace components in the future, extending the lifespan of the laptop and reducing electronic waste. The website also offers a community forum where users can share tips and advice on building and maintaining their laptops, as well as troubleshooting issues.

## Should You Buy One?

Personally, if Framework sold laptops in India, it would've been my next device for sure but quite ironically I am writing this blog post on a MacBook Air with almost 0 upgradability or repairability. My only gripe with the Framework Laptop at launch was that it only had Intel based CPUs and had no AMD option but as of March 2023 AMD 7000 series and Intel 13th generation options were introduced for the 13 inch laptop.

The Framework laptop is definitely the successor to the Thinkpad T series. Almost everything in the device is replaceable or even upgradeable and the best part is that there are barely any screws. Instead the laptop actually uses magnets to keep everything in place, which is more user friendly. You can find all the components on the Framework Marketplace. 

## Conclusion

Framework is a laptop company that is changing the way we think about laptops. Their commitment to open source technology, modular design, and upgradability is commendable. With their new products and emphasis on sustainability, Framework is leading the way in the laptop industry. If you're in the market for a new laptop, consider Framework for their innovative design and commitment to sustainability.
